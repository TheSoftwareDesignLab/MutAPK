The service which records the data runs in the background and is automatically started if you restart your device.  Several counters can be defined for each network interface. A counter is a view over the data so you can delete and recreate counters without any lose of information.  In order to add a new counter, long click on the interface item. A context menu appears. Just select \"Add a counter\". To remove the counter, long click on it and select \"Remove counter\".  To change the type of the counter (\"Total\", \"Last days\", \"Single day\", \"Monthly\"), long click on it again and select \"Change type\".  Some counters support a duration value. E.g. the \"Single day\" counter can be used to show a \"Today\" or a \"Yesterday\" counter. Just set the duration to the appropriate value.  An alert can be defined for each counter. If the defined value is exceeded, a notification will be displayed.  To reset all data for an interface, long click on the interface and select \"Reset all\". This will erase "<b>ALL</b>" the data of the interface so think twice before you click.  It is possible to define the start date of your data plan for the \"Monthly\" counter. Currently, only the day of the month is needed and defaults to the 1th. To set another date, long click on the \"Monthly\" counter and select \"Set start date\".
